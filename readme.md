# WebView2 C Prototype

Planning it to extend to a full fledged open world fps.

Check [here for a DirectX12 proof of concept of the same idea.](https://github.com/bsld/C-UWP-DX12-Proof-of-Concept). Here we are trying with WebGPU inside WebView2 and C backend. It's so because I like both JavaScript and C and I found working with DirectX12 API cumbersome directly with C (no it's not about C vs C++ - I would not use C++ either for DirectX12) so I want to use JavaScript to manage the native renderer but C to handle things like input and different geometry file formats.
